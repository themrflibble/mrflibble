                <p>Having picked up a guitar at the age of 14, music has been a key part of my life. I have seen the Manic Street Preachers over 35 times and have been to every major music festival in the UK. In school I learned trumpet and the violin, I self/internet-taught guitar, bass, drums, mandolin. Music theory fascinates me.</p>

                <p>I am a Trustee for Nottingham Hackspace, one of the largest makerspaces in the UK.</p>

                <p>I have participated in 7 half-marathons, 5 triathlons, 1 duathlon, and 2 kilomathons (26.2km). I achieved approx 250 days of a daily run streak before I injured my ankle. I have cycled London to Paris twice, one in 25.5 hours non-stop (except the 1 hour ferry). In Feb 2021 I was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes and I am carefully going to restart my exercise. </p>
