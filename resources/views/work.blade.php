                <p>I am keen to evolve city centres into more of a place for leisure. Many cities and towns are full of empty properties. Since COVID-19 struck and the country was understandably closed down it’s made it worse. Things need to change in order for towns and cities to make more than a comeback, they and we need them to thrive.</p>
