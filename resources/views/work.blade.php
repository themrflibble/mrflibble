                <p class="mb-0">I own the Escape Room brand “<a href="https://cryptologyrooms.co.uk/" target="_blank">Cryptology</a>” which was established in 2014. All games are designed, produced, and built in-house - including the software. There are branches in Nottingham and Sheffield.</p>
                <p>The Nottingham branch currently has the UK’s top-rated Escape Room, voted for by Escape Room enthusiasts on the website <a href="https://escapethereview.co.uk/location/uk/" target="_blank">Escape The Review</a>.</p>

                <p>I have developed Escape Room software which combines all the management and game-running functions in one package, called Tempus.</p>

                <p>I am a Trustee for <a href="https://nottinghack.org.uk/" target="_blank">Nottingham Hackspace</a>, one of the largest makerspaces in the UK.</p>

                <p>I am keen to evolve city centres into more of a place for leisure. Many cities and towns are full of empty properties. Since COVID-19 struck and the country was understandably closed down it’s made it worse. Things need to change in order for towns and cities to make more than a comeback, they and we need them to thrive.</p>
