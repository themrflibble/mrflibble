                <p>The Nottingham branch currently has the UK’s top-rated Escape Room, voted for by Escape Room enthusiasts on the website Escape The Review.</p>

                <p>I have developed Escape Room software which combines all the management and game-running functions in one package, called Tempus.</p>

                <p>I am a Trustee for Nottingham Hackspace, one of the largest makerspaces in the UK.</p>

                {{-- <p>I own a Grilled Cheese, Café, Wine, and Deli Shop in Nottingham City Centre called Cheese Emporium.</p> --}}

                <p>I am keen to evolve city centres into more of a place for leisure. Many cities and towns are full of empty properties. Since COVID-19 struck and the country was understandably closed down it’s made it worse. Things need to change in order for towns and cities to make more than a comeback, they and we need them to thrive.</p>
