                <p>Hi, I’m Mark and I live in Nottingham (Robin Hood county) in the UK.</p>

                <p class="mb-0">You could argue that I’m a Jack of all trades, master of none.</p>
                <p>I’m approaching 40 and I have recently concluded that the ideas I am passionate about I should see through.</p>

                <p>I used to be a buyer for a UK Electronics Retailer, this took me to Hong Kong, Germany, and China. I worked for this company for 13 years, I genuinely loved this job. After feeling like I had ticked all the buyer boxes, I struggled to find my career path. I had dabbled with programming since I was a boy, and saw my future in programming. That was until I played an Escape Room in 2013.</p>

                <p class="mb-0">I own an Escape Room franchise and have Escape Room Booking, Staff Management, and Clue System software available.</p>
        {{--         <p>I have a café in Nottingham centre called Cheese Emporium.</p> --}}
                <p class="mb-0">I am a Trustee for Nottingham Hackspace.</p>
                <p>I am passionate about reinvigorating city centres as the high street becomes more abandoned by retailers.</p>

                <p>I play guitar, bass, drums, mandolin, violin - all JOATMON.</p>
